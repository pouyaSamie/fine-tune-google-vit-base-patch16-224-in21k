Fine-Tuning Google ViT for Beans Disease Classification
=======================================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains the code for fine-tuning the Google ViT (Vision Transformer) model, specifically the `google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k` variant, for the task of classifying diseases in beans images. The model is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset and fine-tuned on a custom dataset of beans images to enable accurate identification of various diseases affecting the crop.

Dataset
-------

The dataset used for fine-tuning consists of high-resolution images capturing different stages of beans plants affected by various diseases. The data includes labeled examples of beans plants suffering from common diseases such as angular leaf spot, rust, and more.

Requirements
------------

*   [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
*   Transformers
*   Datasets
*   Huggingface_hub
